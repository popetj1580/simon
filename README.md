# simon

For the most part, I tried to implement the HTML without peeking. I think I've figured out most of what I needed to in order for the elements to work as I'd expect them to. I did look at the Simon HTML when needed to get more guidance. I hope that I've learned everything I need in order to make HTML for my startup project

P.S. The odd shapes for my Simon buttons is intentional!
